## Adding a new core
To add a new core, you will need to edit the `_data/cores.yml` file. At a minimum, you must add the fields marked `<required>`:

```yaml
- username: spiritualized1997              #<required>
  cores:                                   #<required>
    - repo: openFPGA-GB-GBC                #<required>
      display_name: Spiritualized GB & GBC #<required>
      identifier: Spiritualized.GBC        #<required>
      platform: Gameboy/Gameboy Color      #<required>
      assets:
        location: Assets/gbc/common/
        files:
        - file_name: gbc_bios.bin
          url: https://archive.org/download/mister-console-bios-pack_theypsilon/Gameboy.zip/GBC_boot_ROM.gb
        - file_name: dmg_bios.bin
          url: https://archive.org/download/mister-console-bios-pack_theypsilon/Gameboy.zip/GB_boot_ROM.gb
          override_location: Assets/gb/common/
```

Information on what these fields mean can be found in the [API description](#getting-the-list-of-cores). There is one additional field `display_name` that is used in the [cores table](https://joshcampbell191.github.io/openfpga-cores-inventory/analogue-pocket.html).
